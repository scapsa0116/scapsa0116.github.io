#### My first CLI project!  Now i understand how little pices of all information learned till now are connected to each other.
#### Module 6 , it's well design to guide me thru all the steps of building an CLI project.
#### of how to creeate basic Gems, how to build a Flow Diagram, how to Scrape information from different web pages.Here is the  scrape page [ https://www.zicasso.com/luxury-vacation-italy-tours/splendors-italian-coastline-elba-island-cinque-terre-tour?zk=rdsa-allcountries&campaign=8703540879&ad_group=93162100771&matched_keyword=&match_type=b&network=g&device=c&ad_position=1t1&creative_id=408441423732&domain=&sitelinks=18915012444&medium=cpc&source=google&gclid=Cj0KCQiApt_xBRDxARIsAAMUMu-4EQLEkdQ-feoPvp8HwhUXQ7aNepRkxSpOlpLAfmRhFJqEpj-93tsaAquaEALw_wcB], located in scaping class, from here i scraped 22 tours in CinqueTerre area, Italy. 
#### 
#### 
#### The app or project that i have in my mind is related to turism in Italy, Cinque Terre coast.
#### My CLI class is conected with the /bin/ file, where i call my CLI.
#### CLI class  alowed to interact with the user,
#### 1. first is outputing 22 places in Cinque Terre with an Welcome sign.
#### 2. is asking the user how many people are treveling: if people are less then 4 and min 2 the price is 300$, and if are more then 4 up to 7 people, price is 500$
#### 3. is asking the user to choose the month for traveling, if its warm season is outputing an specific travel schedule, if is in the time of cold season is outputing different tour schedule
#### 4. is asking the user to choose the date of traveling, if the date is grater than 31 is looping the user back to choose an other date. 
#### 5. is asking the user to exit the program, in case user is typing wrong the word exit the program will automaticly exit.
#### 
#### The scraping class interacts with places class, and CLI. 
#### Places class aloweds to creat new instances of the tour, build new tours, and also puts the information of the scraped tours, like the name and some description.  
#### Notes file has details of the steps of the app, and the steps of how user interact with tour app.
