### Javascript has seven data types: numbers, strings, booleans, symbols, objects, null, and undefined.

### For type checking we are using typeOf operator. The number type Of are not divaded in boolean or decimal, JavaScript only has a single, all-encompassing "NUMBER" type. 
### Undifine data type meand more like value not asign. When we receice a error of undefine, we always have to look what is in front of the dot of undefine, this well mean the the value of specific key or variable is undefine. Type of Null is an object, we often set it as a value, to do not get an error of undefine. Data type of string is always wrapped in quotes and it could be added and concated under a variable. 

### Comparasion are very common while working on a project, often are used in if statements. 
### strict equality operator (===)
### strict inequality operator (!==)
### loose equality operator (==)
### loose inequality operator (!=)

### Compare Numbers with Relational Operators, are having the same meaning as symbols from mathematics 
### greater than (>)
### greater than or equals (>=)
### less than (<)
### less than or equals (<=)

### JS Fundamentals Conditionals are the statements that control the flow in applications 
### "if" and "else" always has to be closed with an "end"

### Data types are common to use and build logic.
