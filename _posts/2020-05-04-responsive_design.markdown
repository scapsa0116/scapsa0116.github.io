#### Responsive design is front end developing that can accommodate users on different platforms. It designs CSS media queries,  text styling, layout styling, media element styling and is responding to the viewport size.

#### Media Queries are designing and building responsive layouts, the content respond to the size of the device. This is an examle of media queries :

### @media only screen and (max-width: 992px) {
### body {
### background-color: blue;
### }
### }

#### In my case i've been practicing applying Responsive Design on my personal project build in sinatra Shopping_list.  Other practical labs required  to construct adjustable Column properties for different screen sizes. I apply @media for creens like phones or screens like computers, By modifying the screen or page size the order of content in the page changes, in this cases rearangement of paragraphs and media are necessary. Virtual viewport is a way to make non-mobile-optimized sites in general look better on narrow screen devices. Responsive design also is a good practice of how better to wrap the invormation in DIV tags or classes, If the information on the page is wrapped correctly than its easy to manipulate the date by design it and making it more flexible.
#### Animal save lab required to  make sure content will be displayed how it's meant be seen across a range of devices and screens and provide a consistent, effective user experience. The lab puts in practice rotating the images, or make the picture move by avoiding overlaping other pictures, and all this effect we can see it by making the screen flexible in size.
#### I practice using  lexbox by creating very unique page layouts. Lexbox can designate some parts of  page to automatically resize depending on window size, filling empty space in a way that is specify.
#### Similar to flexbox, are grid properties to build parts of an HTML page that grow and shrink dynamically, looking good on a variety of screen sizes. One charachterisc of grid is that  automatically  can handle the stretching and shrinking of elements by aligning them to rows and columns. This is an examle of greed template:

### grid-template: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr / 1fr 1fr 1fr;

#### Any time we want to implement a CSS grid, we must define it within the display property of the parent element. The grid-template property is actually shorthand for two other properties, grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows.


#### Responsive design is a neccesary in the procces of creating a well design app or webpage. It gives the user a better quality of viewing the content of the page. Organises the HTML and all imagines frim the page.
