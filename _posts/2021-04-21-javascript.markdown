### JavaScript is a powerfull tool that has the ability to manipulate the DOM and we can build greate functionality with. When learning how JavaScript works I would focus on building class objects and how to manipulate the dom on its order. Class Objects is easy to read and understand, its a functionality that fundamentally change the way we design our code. Each class has the ability to generate copies of itself, referred to as instances. When creating a classs instance we are using constuctor method. Also JS OO has getter and setter methods. With set method we can change the proprety of methos and with get we can return calculated or dynamic also we have static methods tyhat are useful ways to create utility methods for  data. JS has extends and super functionality that inherit the class methods from an other class.
